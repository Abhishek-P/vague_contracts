It's relatively new and he recently had a home inspection to confirm the conditions mentioned in his policy are met. One day, rainfall and wind gusts up to 40 mph cause damage to Tom's home.

When he calls his insurer, however, the insurer disputes his claim, claiming that the damage Tom experienced is uncovered."
